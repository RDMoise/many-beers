I collect beer labels. I also do science. One financially supports the other.

All data are in csv files. Legend has it that one day the missing ABV info will be filled up.

Numbering started with the 172th beer on 27/03/2018. Yes it's a special date.

All plots are to be made using beer yellow. Beer brown or beer amber may be acceptable.

I have committed the cardinal sin of committing pdf plots. Yes sue me.
